# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier – Task 6

This task demonstrates the implementation of KNN classification using the Iris dataset. Key steps include:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature normalization
- Training KNN models with various K values
- Evaluating performance using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Visualizing decision boundaries

## 📊 Libraries Used
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

## 🔍 Key Learnings
- Instance-based learning
- Distance metrics in classification
- Importance of K selection

## 📌 Best Accuracy
Achieved with K = X (fill based on output)
